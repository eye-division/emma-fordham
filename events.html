    When our friend Johanna moved back to Sweden we got together in the studio to create a leaving present for her. Working with the type of papers that are burnt as offerings in the temples, we collaged a unique and personal friendship portrait."

<div class="editable">
	<p>I tutor privately and run workshops from my studio in Wong Chuk Hang. Each class is tailor made to the individual participants and will have different goals and objectives. I've helped interior designers free up their drawing skills, helped IB students develop and formulate their course work and held an Art Jam for the Swedish ladies of SWEA to name a few. I also had the opportunity to travel and teach abroad spending two memorable days with young volunteers at the NGO Restless Development in Kathmandu, Nepal. The focus was on experimental drawing and painting and my aim was to equip them with skills they themselves could use in the field. Later that month my travels took me to Calcutta and Future Hope, a charity run school for former street children. There I held workshops with the senior girls and with the very enthusiastic younger pupils.</p>
