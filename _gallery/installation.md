title: Installation
description_markdown: >-
  I had lived in my village for six months before I found this abandoned school house. The path that leads up to it is almost overgrown and it's situated in a lonely place away from other buildings. Hong Kong is not just about the gleaming skyscrapers. It also consists of many abandoned villages and former communal buildings like this school. People simply uprooted and left the islands and outlying territories when traditional ways of living became obsolete and new opportunities arose in the city. I have started to use this old school house as my canvas and install new artworks in there from time to time. I like the idea that people might stumble across the work if they even find the overgrown pathway to the school in the first place. Hand cut paper stencils depicting rows of tower blocks have been layered onto the old blackboard. New glass drawings have been installed in some of the rusting window frames.
