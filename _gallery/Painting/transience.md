title: Transience
description_markdown: >-
  Just like nature, the city can be seen as organic and living, in constant
  growth and decay. Construction and demolition is ongoing, sometimes with
  little or no regard for history and collective memory. In Hong Kong you often
  see veiled buildings, clad in netting and bamboo scaffolding. To me these
  buildings represent that moment when something new is in progress but has not
  yet become a defined part of the official urban landscape. This part of the
  city is still under wraps and it's story yet untold.&nbsp;
