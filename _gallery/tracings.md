title: Tracings
description_markdown: >-
  In this series I traced the topography lines of real places in Hong Kong where land has been earmarked for major development. Although the plans are not yet realised they exists and loom over the landscape like a ghostly vision. On top of the contour lines I paint architectural plans, floor plans and high rise residential buildings. 

  Through tracing and mapping we try to understand the terrain and our surroundings. 'Trace' also means to follow or ascertain a course of development. It can be interpreted as trying to track down and find a pathway or a trail through time and history. Landscape always contains traces of both past and present as well as our projected future dreams and aspirations.
