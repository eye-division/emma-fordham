title: Transience
description_markdown: >-
  My paintings evolve from observing and exploring the ever-changing surface of the city. Just like nature, the city can be seen as organic and living, in constant growth and decay. Construction and demolition is ongoing, sometimes with little or no regard for history and collective memory. At the same time demolition of the old and construction of the new can be seen as progress and improvement. In Hong Kong you often see veiled buildings, clad in netting and bamboo scaffolding. To me these buildings represent that moment when something new is in progress but has not yet become a defined part of the official urban landscape. This part of the city is still under wraps and it's story yet untold.

  Hong Kong was built because of its natural, deep water harbour. Shipping trade is an intricate part of the city's history and is still a huge industry. I see enormous cargo ships from all over the world sail in and out of the city on a daily basis. I immediately became fascinated by the scale of these ships and the frequency with which they pass through, day and night. They are huge, weigh thousands of tonnes, yet they glide past almost elegantly in complete silence. You never see much evidence of life on board and they appear sealed off and totally self contained. Their names conjure up romantic images from far-flung places, yet many ships are actually sailing under a flag of convenience meaning that notions of origin and nationality are obscured and blurred.
