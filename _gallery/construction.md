title: Construction
description_markdown: >-
  This series of work was developed whilst living in Shanghai. The speed and scale of construction going on everywhere in the city completely changed my painting. Building sites embody the frenetic energy and continuous construction and expansion of the city. I&rsquo;m trying to capture that moment when something new is in progress but has not yet become a defined part of the official urban landscape. Whatever it is that&rsquo;s being built is still mysteriously under wraps, draped in a green protective netting seen everywhere in China. At night these construction sites look almost beautiful when everything is floodlit and silhouetted. In my canvases I have tried to capture this artificial light and the fragile shapes of the tall and gangly cranes.
